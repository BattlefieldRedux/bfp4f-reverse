Variant A:

1. make a RunClient.bat and fill it with

start BFP4f.exe +webSiteHostName "localhost" +battleFundsHostName "localhost" +survey 0 +dc 1 +sessionId 1234 +lang en +soldierName "mysoldier" +multi 1 +frontendUrl "http://localhost/"

2. make a RunServer.bat and fill it with

start BFP4f_w32ded.exe +dedicated +sessionId 1234 +punkbuster 0 +multi 1  +magma 0

go from here any other way


Variant B:

(0.) write this into "hosts" file (google its location) " 127.0.0.1 gosredirector.ea.com" without the quotes, notice the space at the start of the line

1. copy bfp4flauncherwv and blazesharkwv into bf4.exe folder

2. run it and launch blaze (*note at this point maybe start a webserver on localhost, it will be run inside the window)
3. launch blazesharkwv and press start

3. switch to launcher tab in bfp4flauncherwv and press launch (edit startparams if you like)
4. for this to work you need proxied zlib.dll and zlib_org.dll (ssl cert bypass)

5. now the bfp4f should start with an additional console window

6. it should start connect to bfp4flauncher's redirector, which sends it to the port of blazesharkwv

7. there you can observer the blaze packets

8. blazeshark relays the packets back and forth between launcher's backend


*you can host in the webserver the files from "extract_frontend", it contains more code showing how to control the exe from within the browser with js
