notice the space at the start of the line!



1. copy bfp4flauncherwv and blazesharkwv into bf4.exe folder


2. run bfp4flauncherwv and launch blaze (here you can start the webserver for the frontend)


3. launch blazesharkwv, switch tabs and press start


3. switch to LAUNCHER tab in bfp4flauncherwv and press launch


4. for this to work you need proxied zlib.dll and zlib_org.dll (zlib_org.dll is the ORIGINAL zlib dll)


5. it should start connect to bfp4flauncher's redirector, which sends it to the port of blazesharkwv


6. blazeshark shows the packets between client and backend backend


7 HELP US FIGURE OUT THE REST !! 


PS: you can host the files from "extracted_frontend", 
it's also able to control the bfp4f Menu from within the browser with jscript
